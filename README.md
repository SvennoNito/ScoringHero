# ScoringHero - The Open-Source Sleep EEG Scoring Software
Welcome to **ScoringHero**, an open-source project designed to assist you in EEG sleep scoring! After being tested and used by multiple labs for over a year, **ScoringHero** has now reached its beta stage and  supports cross-platform compatibility 🚀

#### 🔍 About
**ScoringHero** is an open-source tool for visualizing long-term EEG recordings, marking events (such as sleep spindles, artefacts, or anything really), and performing sleep scoring.

#### 🚀 How to get the latest release
**ScoringHero** is available for *Windows* and *MacOS*. For Windows, it is packaged as a standalone executable (`.exe`). For MacOS, it comes in versions for older (`x86_64 architecture`) and newer Mac laptops (`arm64 architecture`).
No installation is required. Simply go to the Releases section on the right of this page, download the appropriate file for your operating system, and execute the file to start **ScoringHero**.

#### 🍏 For Mac users
**ScoringHero** is not registered with Apple (as this would imply a yearly fee). This means you need to manually allow its execution. Follow these steps to run the software:
1) Open Terminal and navigate to your Downloads folder.
2) Run the following command to give execution rights to the software:
   - `chmod +x scoringhero_macOS_arm64` (for ARM64 version)
   - `chmod +x scoringhero_macOS_x86_64`(for x86_64 version)
3) Go to System Preferences > Privacy & Security.
4) Click **Open Anyway** when you see the message: *"scoringhero_macOS_arm64 was blocked to protect your Mac."*
